## Ubiqum-Soccer-League
This is one of my first 100% self built projects. It is a static children's soccer league website which focuses on CSS, CSS animations and Flexbox. The technology stack is purely HTML/CSS. I was very happy to recive a lot of compliments from fellow programmers on the design, still I tend to be hard on myself when it comes to self evaluation. You be the judge!

Design: Desktop (The landing page is responsive)

Please visit the deployed version and wait a couple of seconds until the banner appears! :D
